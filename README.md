# Phase 3 Project Favorite Movie Theaters

## To start using app

1. Download this repository by clicking this link https://github.com/czaudiovisual/phase-3-project
2. You should have a minimum of two models with a one to many relationship.
3. You should build out a simple **React** frontend to give your user 3 of the 4
   CRUD abilities for at least one of your resources. For example, build out a
   todo list. A user should be able to create a new todo, see all todos,
   update a todo item, and delete a todo. Todos can be grouped into categories,
   so that a todo has many categories and categories have many todos.
4. Use good OO design patterns. You should have separate classes for your
   models.
